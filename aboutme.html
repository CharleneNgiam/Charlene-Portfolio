        <p>
            Hi, I am Charlene.
        <br>
            I am currently still studying, at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
        <br>
            My current career goal is to become a designer in user experience interface.
        <br>
            I am someone who enjoys the challenges of making great design and pursuing fresh ideas. 
        <br>
            My personal goal is to learn more and achieve great design to contribute in the area of user <br> experience and bring in my new ideas to life that clients will appreciate.
        <br>
        <br>
